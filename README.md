essential-albums
================

[@samlambert](https://github.com/samlambert) started this whole essential albums repo thing, and I think it's a pretty cool idea so I'm doing my own.

This repo is a way of people recommending music to me. I love discovering new music and this might help me discover new stuff.

The list of albums is contained in [this file](https://github.com/charliesome/essential-albums/blob/master/albums.md).

You will be able to see a list of albums I've listened to and what rating (out of 5) I've given them.

To recommend an album send a pull request on [albums.md](https://github.com/charliesome/essential-albums/blob/master/albums.md) and add as many rows to the [Recommended](https://github.com/charliesome/essential-albums/blob/master/albums.md#recommended) table as you desire. Hopefully we will get some good discussion going.

Once I have listened to the album I will rate it and move it to the Heard section.
